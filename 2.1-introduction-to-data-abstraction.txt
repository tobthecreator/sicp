Data abstraction is a methodoly that enables us to 
isolate how a compound data object is used from the details of how it 
is constructed from more primitive objects.

"our programs should use data in such a way as to make no assumptions
about the data that are not strictly necessary for performing the task at hand".

At the same time, a "concrete" data is defined independent of the programs that use that dataa.

We'll have selectors and constructors that implement abstract data in terms of that concrete representation.

We'll dive into that into the next section.

Okay, I get the first part of that.

In that linear combination example, that function has no idea what is going on, it's just operating in a set way.
