We can think of data as some collection of selectors and constructors,
together with specified conditions that these procedures must fulfill in order to
be a valid represenation.

That's very interesting.

A piece of data is only as good as it's ability to be used, and to fit a specific mold.

They actually did this.  They didn't define what a pair was and how it worked, 
just showed us the methods and let us play from there.

The functions we were given were language primitives. But we could overwrite them
ourselves if we dared.

This way of thinking about data does not come naturally. 

But in theory you only need to be able to run a pairs operation on something
and see the output to know if it's a valid pair or not.

So what we're saying is basically
