To become experts, we must learn to visualize the processes generated by various types of procedures. Only after we have developed such a skill can we learn to reliably construct programs that exhibit the desired behavior.

I like the point about photography here.  It reminds of PG's notes on painters.

Creative acts are the same in every domain.

I also like this language, although I don't feel like I've internalized it:
"A procedure is a pattern for the local evolution of a computational process"

If we go back to the first chapter, we were talking about the process being like a spirit
we're conjuring as a sorcerer, and the procedures being the way we shape and guide that power.

I need to reflect on that more.

"The language also serves as a framework within which we organize our ideas about processes"

"We are about to study the idea of a computational process. Computational processes are abstract beings that inhabit computers. As they evolve, processes manipulate other abstract things called data. The evolution of a process is directed by a pattern of rules called a program. People create programs to direct processes. In effect, we conjure the spirits of the computer with our spells.

A computational process is indeed much like a sorcerer's idea of a spirit. It cannot be seen or touched. It is not composed of matter at all. However, it is very real. It can perform intellectual work. It can answer questions. It can affect the world by disbursing money at a bank or by controlling a robot arm in a factory. The programs we use to conjure processes are like a sorcerer's spells. They are carefully composed from symbolic expressions in arcane and esoteric programming languages that prescribe the tasks we want our processes to perform."
