The pairs we've been playing with we'll call 
box-and-pointers

The car is the pointer to the value, the cdr

We can cosntruct arbitrarily large sets of data that we can
then navigate, where the cdr is the pointer to another cdr, and so on

In general, an operation for combining data objects
satisfies the closure property if the results
of combining things with that operation can 
themselves be combined using the same operation

So I can combine two primitives into a pair.

But I can also combine two pairs into a pair with the
same op.

That satisfies the property.

Closure is the key power in any means of combination
because it permits us to create hierarchal structures.

Structures that are made up of parts, which themselves are made up of parts, etc.

Let's dig in. I know this is going to fuck with my brain today.
