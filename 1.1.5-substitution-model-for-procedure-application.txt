Substitution model.

A model that determines the "meaning" of procedure application.

The book walks through an example of breaking down procedure f into a tree, then evaluating the tree leaf by leaf and walking back to the value.  It calls this normal-order evaluation.

Normal order evaluation is "fully expand and then reduce"

Lisp uses applicative order evaluation.  This is "evaluate the arguments and then apply".
