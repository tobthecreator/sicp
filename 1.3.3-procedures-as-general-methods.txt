We brought in procedures to abstract patterns for operations to make them independent of variables involved.

But then we found many repeating patterns in our procedures, so we brought in higher-order-procedures

No we have procedures that express general methods of computation,
independent of the procedures they're operating.

Some very complicated examples follow that I don't feel like dissecting.
