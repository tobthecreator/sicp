(define (cube x) (* x x x))

we already know that procedures are abstractions of operations we 
want to run through in different instances.

(* 3 3 3)
(* x x x)
(* y y y) 

we could repeat operations constantly and never abstract, but
abstracting saves time and saves us from operating at the base
level everywhere in our code.

But there is something hidden here. If we're only ever capable
of using simple variables like strings and numbers, we'd still be
caught repeating more macro-scopic patterns constantly

If you treat the pattern as more of a concept, you come to HOPs

we're going to start constructing procedures out of procedures
